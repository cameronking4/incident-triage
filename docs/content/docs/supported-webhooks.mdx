# Supported Webhooks

Incident Triage is evolving into an event-driven Devin orchestration platform. The bigger promise for enterprises: **configure a webhook to trigger Devin with prompt templates**. Connect alerts from any supported source—most provide native webhooks, so consumers paste a URL and go.

## Vision: Event-Driven Devin Platform

- **Configure once** — Connect Azure, AWS, PagerDuty, Prometheus, or others. Map each alert type to a prompt template.
- **Managed harness** — Devin runs with your ACU limits, guardrails, and tags. No code changes for new sources—just config and a prompt.
- **Extensible** — Web app, CLI, or GitHub Action; all react to the same events and share the same engine.

## Native Webhooks (No Custom Code)

These services POST directly to your webhook URL. Consumers configure a URL in the source’s UI or config—no Lambda, no custom scripts.

| Service | What to configure | Events |
|---------|-------------------|--------|
| **Prometheus Alertmanager** | `webhook_configs` in alertmanager.yml | Firing alerts |
| **Azure Monitor** | Action Group → Webhook action | Metric, log, activity alerts |
| **PagerDuty** | Extensions → Webhook | Incident create/update |
| **GitHub** | Repo/org webhooks | deployment_status, check_run, workflow_run |
| **Datadog** | Integrations → Webhooks | Alert payloads |
| **Grafana** | Alerting → Contact points → Webhook | Alert rules |
| **Sentry** | Internal Integration as alert action | Issue alerts, metric alerts |
| **PostHog** | Destinations → Webhook | Event data (real-time) |
| **Vercel Deployments** | Settings → Webhooks (Pro/Enterprise) | Deployment created, succeeded, error, cancelled, promoted |

### Quick Setup Examples

**Prometheus (Alertmanager):**

```yaml
receivers:
  - name: 'devin-triage'
    webhook_configs:
      - url: 'https://your-platform.com/webhook/prometheus'
```

**Azure Monitor:** Create Action Group → add Webhook action → paste URL.

**Vercel:** Team Settings → Webhooks → select events (e.g. Deployment Error) → enter endpoint URL.

## Requires a Bridge (Consumer or Platform)

| Service | Limitation | Typical approach |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| **AWS CloudWatch Alarms** | No direct HTTP POST | CloudWatch → SNS → Lambda → POST to your webhook |
| **PostHog (funnel alerts)** | Native webhook sends events, not “alert on funnel drop” | Use PostHog webhook with filters, or Zapier/Make for funnel-specific triggers |

For AWS, a ready-made Lambda template (SNS → HTTP POST) reduces consumer setup to one deploy + paste webhook URL.

## Not Alert Webhook Sources

| Service | Why |
|---------|-----|
| **OpenTelemetry** | OTel is a telemetry spec (traces, metrics, logs). It exports to backends. Alerts come from whatever consumes OTel—Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog—and those have webhooks. |
| **Vercel Analytics** | Web Analytics is for page views and Core Web Vitals. It is not an alerting system and has no webhook. |

## Summary: Consumer Setup Effort

| Source | Effort | Consumer action |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Prometheus | ~5 min | Edit alertmanager.yml, add webhook URL |
| Azure Monitor | ~5–10 min | Create Action Group, add webhook, attach to alert rules |
| PagerDuty | ~5 min | Add webhook extension to service |
| GitHub | ~3 min | Add webhook in repo settings, select events |
| Sentry | ~5 min | Create Internal Integration, add as alert action |
| PostHog | ~5 min | Add webhook destination, configure URL |
| Vercel Deployments | ~5 min | Settings → Webhooks, select events, add URL |
| AWS CloudWatch | 15–30 min | Deploy Lambda (SNS → HTTP) or use platform-provided template |

For most sources, setup is a few minutes per integration. A config UI that generates webhook URLs and provider-specific instructions makes it even easier.
